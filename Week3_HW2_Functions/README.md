### Let's practice some functions...
1. Define a function maxOfThree that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.
2. 
    - Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:
        - Take a Celsius temperature from the user and convert it to Fahrenheit
        - Return string as output: "SOMETHING degrees Celsius is Something degrees Fahrenheit"
    - Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:
        - Now take a Fahrenheit temperature from the user and convert it to Celsius
        - Return string as output: "SOMETHING degrees Fahrenheit is SOMETHING degrees Celsius"
3. Create an array of at least five Student objects with the following properties: name, activity, gender
- Filter all those students who are into swimming
- Filter all those students who are in the activity entered by the user. For example, if the user enters "Basketball" display only students with basketball as their activity 
4. Traverse through an array (either number or string array) and display each value with their index position using Array.map method
HINT: For index, take a look at the Syntax and Parameters sections in the MDN DocLinks to an external site. for Array.map

BONUS: 
Convert as many of the functions above into one-line arrow functions (which means no curly brackets and no explicit use of the return keyword)
