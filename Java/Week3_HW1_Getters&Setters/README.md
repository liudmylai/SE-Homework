## Mod3 Week3 HW1 (Getters & Setters)
### Getter & Setter Methods: 
* Create a Computer class that has 3 variables. The first variable will have a name. The second variable will be the year of the computer. Last variable will be the cost of the computer
* All 3 variables should be private instance variables and must use getters to retrieve the data and setters to set the variables
* Create at least two POJOs and use their getters and setters in the main method of a Starter class
* Add at least one static method to your Computer class and give it some logic (be as creative as you like)
