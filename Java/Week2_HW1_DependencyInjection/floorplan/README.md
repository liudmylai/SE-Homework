## Week2 HW1 (Dependency Injection)
Create a Spring boot application and apply 'Dependency Injection'  within the classes that are related to each other with Has-A-Relation only

### Steps to follow:
1. Create at least 3 Java Bean Classes(POJO). Think of your own example.
2. Define property variables and methods to give them some behavior functionality. For example: calculate method and/or any other method of your choice.
3. Run and test this application from the main method to display appropriate results.
