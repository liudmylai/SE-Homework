## Week1 Day2 Lab (Loops)
### Practice for loops and while loops:
**For loops**
1. Write a for loop that runs 10 times and print the value of the controlling variable all on the same line
2. Write a for loop that iterates between 1 and 10, but counts by 2. Inside the loop, print your name on different lines 
3. Write a for loop to print asterisk (*) 15 times on the same line
4. Write a for loop for the given output:
```
1.   1, 3, 5, 7, 9
2.   2, 4, 6, 8, 10
```

**While loops**
1. Use a while loop to add up the numbers 1 to 20 into one variable. Print out the sum at the end
2. Use a while loop to print out the even number from 1 to 20

**Nested loops**
1. Write a for loop to display the following outputs: 
```
1               11111
22              2222
333             333
4444            44
55555           5
```
2. Write a for loop that iterates from 1 - 20. Should print “prime” for all prime numbers.
