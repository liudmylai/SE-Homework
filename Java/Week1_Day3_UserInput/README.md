## Week1 Day3 Lab (User Input)
### Let's take some inputs from the user:
1. Take a number of rows from the user. Write a for loop for each output below (for this example, the user wanted five rows): 
```
 1              54321
 12             4321
 123            321
 1234           21
 12345          1
```
2. Take a number from the user and print the first 10 multiples of that number.
3. Take a character from the user and determine if it's a consonant or a vowel.
