## Week2 Day1 Lab (Classes/Objects)
### Classes with objects: 
1. Create a class named Student that can hold the data for a single student from the following table. Write a **parameterized constructor** to get the values in instance variables while creating student objects. Write a method to display all the fields of each student and then write another method (getAverage) that **returns** the average of three subjects.
``` 
Student ID  First Name  Last Name  Student Email    Subject 1  Subject 2  Subject 3

0001        Todd        Hopkins    Thop@gmail.org   90.5       80.0       70.0

0002        Mario       Wells      Wario@gmail.org  80.3       80.5       100.0
```
2. Create two Rectangle objects with a method Area which returns the area of each. Length and width of two rectangles should be passed as parameters to the constructor. These values should be user inputted (using Scanner).
